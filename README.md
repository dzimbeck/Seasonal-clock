# Seasonal clock
 A more accurate way of keeping time.

  Welcome to the true seasonal calendar. This calendar does not require daylight savings as the time is always
  perfect for your location. This makes it easy for you to wake up and sleep with the sun. This is better for
  planning your day and having a healthy circadian rhythm. Hence, this calendar perfectly keeps time and synchronizes
  seasons. There are 12 months and 3 months per season with the year starting in Spring. Much like the Enoch calendar
  there is an extra day added at the end of each season for the equinox. There are 4 weeks per month with two to three
  extra days added at the end for the equinox. They are not considered days of the week. At the end of the year there
  is an intermission with one or two days added to synchronize the next year with the sun. This could be considered
  both a solar and lunar calendar as it accurately tracks both as closely as possible. Every month starts on Sunday
  and the new year always falls on March 22nd compared to the traditional gregorian calendar.
